# Snake Game
This is a basic implementation of the classic **Snake** game using **Pygame**. Each time the snake eats a fruit, it grows in length, and the player's score increases. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the edge of the play area.

## Features
- The game tracks the player's score.
- Simple directional controls using the arrow keys.
- The snake grows longer with each fruit it consumes.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the window edges or with itself.

## Requirements
To run this game, you need to have **Python** installed along with the **Pygame** library.

### Install Pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
