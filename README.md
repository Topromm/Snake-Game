# Snake Game

This is a basic implementation of the classic **Snake** game using **Pygame**, a popular Python library for game development. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen to eat fruits. Each time the snake eats a fruit, it grows in length, and the player's score increases. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundary of the window.

## Features
- Snake grows longer with each fruit it eats.
- The game tracks the player's score.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the window edges or with itself.
- Simple directional controls using the arrow keys.

## Requirements
To run this game, you need to have **Python** installed along with the **Pygame** library.

### Install Pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
